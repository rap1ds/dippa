% Lines starting with a percent sign (%) are comments. LaTeX will
% not process those lines. Similarly, everything after a percent
% sign in a line is considered a comment. To produce a percent sign
% in the output, write \% (backslash followed by the percent sign).
% ==================================================================
% Usage instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The file is heavily commented so that you know what the various
% commands do. Feel free to remove any comments you don't need from
% your own copy. When redistributing the example thesis file, please
% retain all the comments for the benefit of other thesis writers!
% ==================================================================
% Compilation instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% General information
% ==================================================================
% Package documentation:
%
% The comments often refer to package documentation. (Almost) all LaTeX
% packages have documentation accompanying them, so you can read the
% package documentation for further information. When a package 'xxx' is
% installed to your local LaTeX environment (the document compiles
% when you have \usepackage{xxx} and LaTeX does not complain), you can
% find the documentation somewhere in the local LaTeX texmf directory
% hierarchy. In ukk.cs.hut.fi, this is /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist,
% and the documentation for the titlesec package (for example) can be
% found at /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/titlesec/titlesec.pdf.
% Most often the documentation is located as a PDF file in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xxx, where xxx is the package name;
% however, documentation for TikZ is in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf
% (this is because TikZ is a front-end for PGF, which is meant to be a
% generic portable graphics format for LaTeX).
% You can try to look for the package manual using the ``find'' shell
% command in Linux machines; the find databases are up-to-date at least
% in ukk.cs.hut.fi. Just type ``find xxx'', where xxx is the package
% name, and you should find a documentation file.
% Note that in some packages, the documentation is in the DVI file
% format. In this case, you can copy the DVI file to your home directory,
% and convert it to PDF with the dvipdfm command (or you can read the
% DVI file directly with a DVI viewer).
%
% If you can't find the documentation for a package, just try Googling
% for ``latex packagename''; most often you can get a direct link to the
% package manual in PDF format.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------


% Document class for the thesis is report
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can change this but do so at your own risk - it may break other things.
% Note that the option pdftext is used for pdflatex; there is no
% pdflatex option.

\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside,pdftex]{report}

% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding
% (ISO-8859-1 works). Change the latin1-option if you use UTF8
% (at some point LaTeX did not work with UTF8, but I'm not sure
% what the current situation is)
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter
% - if the letter is shown pixelated, you should change this setting
% (try commenting out the entire line, for example).
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}
% The babel package provides hyphenating instructions for LaTeX. Give
% the languages you wish to use in your thesis as options to the babel
% package (as shown below). You can remove any language you are not
% going to use.
% Examples of valid language codes: english (or USenglish), british,
% finnish, swedish; and so on.
\usepackage[finnish,swedish,english]{babel}


% Font selection
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default LaTeX font is a very good font for rendering your
% thesis. It is a very professional font, which will always be
% accepted.
% If you, however, wish to spicen up your thesis, you can try out
% these font variants by uncommenting one of the following lines
% (or by finding another font package). The fonts shown here are
% all fonts that you could use in your thesis (not too silly).
% Changing the font causes the layouts to shift a bit; you many
% need to manually adjust some layouts. Check the warning messages
% LaTeX gives you.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% To find another font, check out the font catalogue from
% http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html
% This link points to the list of fonts that support maths, but
% that's a fairly important point for master's theses.

% Optional packages
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Select those packages that you need for your thesis. You may delete
% or comment the rest.

% Natbib allows you to select the format of the bibliography references.
% The first example uses numbered citations:
\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}
% The second example uses author-year citations.
% If you use author-year citations, change the bibliography style (below);
% acm style does not work with author-year citations.
% Also, you should use \citet (cite in text) when you wish to refer
% to the author directly (\citet{blaablaa} said blaa blaa), and
% \citep when you wish to refer similarly than with numbered citations
% (It has been said that blaa blaa~\citep{blaablaa}).
% \usepackage[square]{natbib}

% The alltt package provides an all-teletype environment that acts
% like verbatim but you can use LaTeX commands in it. Uncomment if
% you want to use this environment.
% \usepackage{alltt}

% The eurosym package provides a euro symbol. Use with \euro{}
\usepackage{eurosym}

% Verbatim provides a standard teletype environment that renderes
% the text exactly as written in the tex file. Useful for code
% snippets (although you can also use the listings package to get
% automatic code formatting).
\usepackage{verbatim}

% The listing package provides automatic code formatting utilities
% so that you can copy-paste code examples and have them rendered
% nicely. See the package documentation for details.
% \usepackage{listings}

% The fancuvrb package provides fancier verbatim environments
% (you can, for example, put borders around the verbatim text area
% and so on). See package for details.
% \usepackage{fancyvrb}

% Supertabular provides a tabular environment that can span multiple
% pages.
%\usepackage{supertabular}
% Longtable provides a tabular environment that can span multiple
% pages. This is used in the example acronyms file.
\usepackage{longtable}

% The fancyhdr package allows you to set your the page headers
% manually, and allows you to add separator lines and so on.
% Check the package documentation.
% \usepackage{fancyhdr}

% Subfigure package allows you to use subfigures (i.e. many subfigures
% within one figure environment). These can have different labels and
% they are numbered automatically. Check the package documentation.
\usepackage{subfigure}

% The titlesec package can be used to alter the look of the titles
% of sections, chapters, and so on. This example uses the ``medium''
% package option which sets the titles to a medium size, making them
% a bit smaller than what is the default. You can fine-tune the
% title fonts and sizes by using the package options. See the package
% documentation.
\usepackage[medium]{titlesec}

% The TikZ package allows you to create professional technical figures.
% The learning curve is quite steep, but it is definitely worth it if
% you wish to have really good-looking technical figures.
\usepackage{tikz}
% You also need to specify which TikZ libraries you use
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathmorphing,decorations.markings}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes}
\usetikzlibrary{patterns}


% The aalto-thesis package provides typesetting instructions for the

% Load this package second-to-last, just before the hyperref package.
% Options that you can use:
%   mydraft - renders the thesis in draft mode.

%   doublenumbering - [optional] number the first pages of the thesis
%                     with roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...); and start
%                     arabic numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) only on the
%                     first page of the first chapter

% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a

% paragraphs.

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if
% you write in English, leave these lines commented!
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{acm}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
\hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}



% The preamble ends here, and the document begins.
% Place all formatting commands and such before this line.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}
% This command adds a PDF bookmark to the cover page. You may leave
% it out if you don't like it...

% Options: finnish, english, and swedish
% These control in which language the cover-page information is shown

% Include an abstract in the language that the thesis is written in,
% and if your native language is Finnish or Swedish, one in that language.

% Abstract in English
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\thesisabstract{english}{
A dissertation or thesis is a document submitted in support of candidature
for a degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and
findings. In some countries/universities, the word thesis or a cognate is used
as part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation is normally
applied to a doctorate, whilst, in others, the reverse is true.

\fixme{Abstract text goes here (and this is an example how to use fixme).}
Fixme is a command that helps you identify parts of your thesis that still
require some work. When compiled in the custom \texttt{mydraft} mode, text
parts tagged with fixmes are shown in bold and with fixme tags around them. When
compiled in normal mode, the fixme-tagged text is shown normally (without
special formatting). The draft mode also causes the ``Draft'' text to appear on
the front page, alongside with the document compilation date. The custom
\texttt{mydraft} mode is selected by the \texttt{mydraft} option given for the
package \texttt{aalto-thesis}, near the top of the \texttt{thesis-example.tex}
file.

The thesis example file (\texttt{thesis-example.tex}), all the chapter content
files (\texttt{1introduction.tex} and so on), and the Aalto style file
(\texttt{aalto-thesis.sty}) are commented with explanations on how the Aalto
thesis works. The files also contain some examples on how to customize various
details of the thesis layout, and of course the example text works as an
example in itself. Please read the comments and the example text; that should
get you well on your way!}

Magmakivet ovat muodostuneet kiteytyneestä magmasta, sedimenttikivet vanhempien
kivilajien rapautuessa ja muodostaessa iskostuneita yhdisteitä, metamorfiset
kivet taas kun magma- ja sedimenttikivet joutuvat syvällä maan kuoressa
lämpötilan ja kovan paineen alaiseksi.

Kivi on epäorgaaninen eli elottoman luonnon aine, mikä tarkoittaa ettei se
sisällä hiiltä tai muita elollisen orgaanisen luonnon aineita. Niinpä kivestä
tehdyt esineet säilyvät maaperässä tuhansien vuosien ajan mätänemättä. Kun
orgaaninen materiaali jättää jälkensä kiveen, tulos tunnetaan nimellä fossiili.

Lilla Vargens universum är det tredje fiktiva universumet inom huvudfäran av de

dels persongalleriet i kortfilmen Tre smä grisar frän 1933 och dess uppföljare,
dels längfilmen Sängen om Södern frän 1946, och dels frän episoden ``Bongo'' i
längfilmen Pank och fägelfri frän 1947. Framför allt de två första har
sedermera även kommit att leva vidare, utvidgas och införlivas i varandra genom
tecknade serier, främst sädana producerade av Western Publishing för
amerikanska Disneytidningar under ären 1945--1984.

Världen runt Lilla Vargen är, i jämförelse med den runt Kalle Anka eller Musse
Pigg, inte helt enhetlig, vilket bland annat märks i Bror Björns skiftande
personlighet. Den har även varit betydligt mer öppen för influenser frän andra
Disneyvärldar, inte minst de tecknade längfilmerna. Ytterligare en skillnad är
att varelserna i vargserierna förefaller stä närmare sina förebilder inom den
verkliga djurvärlden. Att vargen Zeke vill äta upp grisen Bror Duktig är till
exempel ett ständigt äterkommande tema, men om katten Svarte Petter skulle fä
för sig att äta upp musen Musse Pigg skulle detta antagligen höja ett och annat
ögonbryn bland läsarna.}

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}

This is my master's thesis, and I am very proud of it.  Of course,
when I write my \emph{real} master's thesis, I will not use the
singular pronoun \emph{I}, but rather try to avoid referring to myself
and speak of the research \emph{we} have conducted---I rarely work
alone, after all.  Yet, both \emph{I} and \emph{we} are correct, and
it depends on the instructor and the supervisor (of course from you,
too), which one they would prefer. Anyway, the tense should be active,
and passive sentenses should be avoided (especially, writing sentences
where the subject is presented with by preposition), so often you
cannot avoid choosing between the pronouns. Life is strange, but there
you have it.

By the way, the preferred order of writing your master's thesis is
about the same as the outline of the thesis: you first discover your
problem and write about that, then you find out what methods you
should use and write about that.  Then you do your implementation, and
document that, and so on.  However, the abstract and introduction are
often easiest to write last.  This is because these really cover the
entire thesis, and there is no way you could know what to put in your
abstract before you have actually done your implementation and
evaluation. Rarely anyone write the thesis from the beginning to the
end just one time, but the writing is more like process, where every
piece of text is written at least twice. Be also prepared to delete
your own text. In the first phase, you can hide it into comments that
are started with \% but during the writing, the many comments should be
visible for your helpers, the instructor and supervisor.

The introduction in itself is rarely very long; two to five pages often
suffice.


\section{Problem statement}

Undergraduate students studying technical subjects do not consider typography
very interesting these days, and therefore the typographical quality of many
theses is unacceptably low.
We plan to rectify this situation somewhat by providing a decent-quality
example thesis outline for students.
We expect that the typographical quality of the master's theses will
dramatically increase as the new thesis outline is taken into use.

\section{Helpful hints}

Read the information from the university master's thesis
pages~\cite{ThesisInstructions} before starting the thesis.  You
should also go through the thesis grading
instructions~\cite{ThesisGrading} together with your instructor and/or
supervisor in the beginning of your work.

\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{section:structure}

You should use transition in your text, meaning that you should help
the reader follow the thesis outline. Here, you tell what will be in
each chapter of your thesis.



% \input{2background.tex}

\chapter{Background}
\label{chapter:background}

The problem must have some background, otherwise it is not
interesting.  You can explain the background here. Probably you should
change the title to something that describes more the content of this
chapter. Background consists of information that help other masters of
the same degree program to understand the rest of the thesis.

Transitions mentioned in Section~\ref{section:structure} are used also
in the chapters and sections. For example, next in this chapter we
tell how to use English language, how to find and refer to sources,
and enlight different ways to include graphics in the thesis.

\section{Language and Structure}

Moreover, the transitions are also used in the paragraph and the
sentence level meaning that all the text is linked together. For example,
the word ``moreover'' here is one way, but of course you should use
variation in the text. Examples of transitional devices (words) and
their use can be found from writing guides, e.g. from the Online
Writing Lab
(OWL)\footnote{http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/574/02/} of
Purdue University or Strunk's Elements of
Style\footnote{http://www.bartleby.com/141/}. Remember that footnotes
are additional information, and they are seldom used.  If you refer to a source, you do no
not use footnote. The right command for the references is \emph{cite}.

The language used in the thesis should be technical (or
scientifical). For example, the abreviations aren't used but all them
are written open (i.e. ``are not''). Since the content itself is often
hard to understand (and explain), the sentences should not be very
long, use complex language with several examples embedded in the same
sentence, and, also, seldom used words and weird euphemism or paraphrases
can make the sentence hard to follow and to read it with only one
time, and making everything even harder to understand all this without
any punctuation marks makes the instructor cry and finally after
trying to correct the language, you will get boomerang, and everyone's
time has just been wasted.

Please use proofreaders before sending even your unfinished version to
the instructor and/or supervisor. You will get better comments when
they do not need first proofread your text. Moreover, they can
consentrate to the content better if the language and spelling
mistakes are not distracting the reading. Several editors have their
own proofreading tools, e.g. ispell in emacs. You can also use
Microsoft Word to proofread your thesis: it can correct also some
grammatical errors and not just misspelled words.

Note also that if you have a section or a subsection, you have to have
at least two of them, or otherwise the section or subsection title is
unnecessary. Same with the paragraphs an: you should not have sections
with only one paragraphe, and single sentence paragraph. Furthermore,
always write some text after the title before the next level title.

\section{Finding and referring to sources}

Never ever copy anything into your theses from somebody else's text
(nor your own previously published text). Never. Not even for starting
point to be rewritten later. The risk is that you forgot the copied
text to your thesis and end up to be accused of plagiarism. Plagiarism
is a serious crime in studies and science and can ruin your career
even its beginning. To repeate: never cut and paste text into your
thesis!

\subsection{Finding sources}

All work is based on someone else's work. You should find the relevant
sources of your field and choose the best of them. Also, you should
refer to the original source where a fact has been mentioned first
time. Remember source evaluation (criticism) with all sources you
find.

Good starting points for finding references in computer science are:
\begin{itemize}
% You can use this command to set the items in the list closer to each other
% (ITEM SEParation, the vertical space between the list items)
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Nelli Portal (Aalto Library): \url{http://www.nelliportaali.fi}
\item ACM Digital library: \url{http://portal.acm.org/}
\item IEEExplore: \url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org}
\item ScienceDirect: \url{http://www.sciencedirect.com/}
\item \ldots although Google Scholar (\url{http://scholar.google.com/}) will
find links to most of the articles from the abovementioned sources, if you
search from within the university network
\end{itemize}

Some of the publishers do not offer all the text of the articles
freely, but the library has agreed on the rights to use the whole
text. Thus, you should sometimes use computers in the domain of the
university in order to get the full text. Sometimes the Nelli Portal
can also help getting the whole article instead of just the abstract.
The library has also brief instrucions how to find
information~\cite{howfindinfo}.

Instead of normal Google, use Google Scholar
(\url{http://scholar.google.fi/}). It finds academic publications whereas
normal Google find too much commercial advertisements or otherwise
biased information. Wikipedia articles should be referred to in the master
thesis only very, very seldomly. You can use Wikipedia for understanding
some basics and finding more sources, but often you cannot be sure if
the article is correct and unbiased.

One important part of the sources that you have found is the reference
list. This way you can find the original sources that all the other
research of the field refer. Often you can also find more information
with the name of the researchers that are often referred in the
articles.

\subsection{Referring to sources}

The main point in referring to sources is to separate your own
thinking and text from that of others. Facts of the research area can
be given without reference, but otherwise you should refer to
sources. This means two things: marking the source in the text where
it has been used, and listing the sources usually in the end of the
thesis in a way that help the reader to find the original source.

There are several bibliography styles, meaning how to form the
bibliography in the end of the thesis. Aalto's library has good
instructions for many styles~\cite{bibinstructions}. You should ask
from your supervisor or instructors which style you should use. This
thesis template uses the number style that is often used in software
engineering. The other style also used in the CS field,
e.g. usability, is the Harvard style where instead of numbers, the
reference is marked into the text with author's name and publishing
year. Other areas use also many other styles for making the lists and
marking the references.

In addition to the list in the end of the thesis, you have to mark the
source in the text where the source is used. There are three places
for the reference: in a sentence before the period, in the end of a
sentence after the period, or in the end of a paragraph. All of them
have different meaning. The main point is that first you paraphrase
the source using your own words and then mark the source. Next, we
give short examples that are marked with \emph{emphasised text}.

\emph{Haapasalo~\cite{HaapasaloThesis} researched database algorithms
  that allows use of previous versions of the content stored in the
  database.} This kind of marking means that this paragraph (or until
the next reference is given) is based on the source mentioned in the
beginning.  Giving the source you should use only the family name of
the first author of the article, and not give any hints about what is
the type of the article that is referred.

\emph{B+-trees offers one way to index data that is stored in to a
  database. Multiversion B+-trees (MVBT) offer also a way to restore
  the data from previous versions of the database. Concurrent MVBT
  allows many simultaneous updates to the database that is was not
  possible with MVBT.~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}} When the marking is
after the period, the reference is retrospective: all the paragraph
(or after previous reference marking) is based on the source given in
its end. If the content is very broad, you can start with saying
\emph{According to Haapasalo}, then continue referring the source with
several separate sentences, and in the end put the marking of your
source \emph{ that shows that CMVBT are the
  best. ~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}}.

If your paragraph has several sources, the above mentioned styles are
not proper. The reader of your thesis cannot know which of your
sources give which of the statements. In this case, it is better to
use more finegraded refering where the reference markings that are
embedded in the sentences. For example, \emph{the multiversion B+-tree
  (MVBT) index of Becker et al.~\cite{becker:1996:mvbt} allows database
  users to query old versions of the database, but the index is not
  transactional.
  It's successor, the transactional MBVT (TMVBT), allows a single transaction
  running in its own thread or process to update the database concurrently
  with other transactions that only read the
  database~\cite{haapasalo:2009:tmvbt}.
  Further development, titled the concurrent MBVT (CMVBT),
  allows several transactions to perform updates to the database at the same
  time~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}}.
  Here, the references are marked before
  the period in the sentences where they are used.

Finally, direct quotes are allowed. However, often you should avoid
them since they do not usually fit in to your text very well. Using
direct quotes has two tricks: quotation marks and the source.  \emph{
  ``Even though deletions in a multiversion index must not physically
  delete the history of the data items, queries and range scans can
  become more efficient, if the leaf pages of the index structure are
  merged to retain optimality.''~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}} Quotes are
hard to make neatly since you should use only as much as needed
without changing the text. Moreover, you often do not really
understand what the author has mentioned with his wordings if you
cannot write the same with your own words. Remember also that never
cut and paste anything without marking the quotation marks right away,
and in general, never cut and paste anything at all!

Sometimes getting the original source can be almost impossible. In an
extremely desperate situation, you can refer with structure \emph{mr
  X~[\ldots] according to ms Y~[\ldots] defined that}, if you find a
source that refers to the original source. Note also that the
reference marking is never used as sentence element (example of how
\textbf{not} to do it: \emph{\cite{HaapasaloThesis} describes
an optimal algorithm for indexing multiversiond databases.}).

\chapter{Environment}
\label{chapter:environment}

A problem instance is rarely totally independent of its environment.
Most often you need to describe the environment you work in, what
limits there are and so on. This is a good place to do that. First we
tell you about the LaTeX working environments and then is an example
from an thesis written some years ago.


\section{LaTeX working environments}
\label{sec:environments}

To create \LaTeX\ documents you need two things: a \LaTeX\ environment for
compiling your documents and a text editor for writing them.

\subsection{Environment}

Fortunately \LaTeX\ can nowadays be found for any (modern) computer
environment, be it Linux, Windows, or Macintosh.
For Linuxes (and other Unix clones) and Macs, I'd recommend \emph{TeX
Live}~\cite{TeXLive}, which is the current default \LaTeX\ distribution for
many Linux flavors such as Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo.
TeX Live is the replacement for the older \emph{teTeX}, which is
no longer developed.

TeX Live works also for Windows machines (at least according to their web
site); however, I have used \emph{MiKTeX}~\cite{MiKTeX} and can recommend it
for Windows.
MiKTeX has a nice package manager and automatically fetches missing packages
for you.

\subsection{Editor}

You can write \LaTeX\ documents with any text editor you like, but having
syntax coloring options and such really helps a lot.
My personal favourite for editing \LaTeX\ is the
\emph{TeXlipse}~\cite{TeXlipse} plugin for the Eclipse IDE~\cite{Eclipse}.
Eclipse is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) initially
created for writing Java code, but it currently has support for editing
languages such as C, C++, JavaScript, XML, HTML, and many more.
The TeXlipse plugin allows you to edit and compile \LaTeX\ documents directly
in Eclipse, and compilation errors and warnings are shown in the Eclipse
\emph{Problems} dialog so that you can locate and fix the issues easily.
The plugin also supports reference traversal so that you can locate the source
line where a label or a citation is defined.

Eclipse is an entire development environment, so it may feel a bit heavy-weight
for editing a document.
If you are looking for a more light-weight option, check out TeXworks.
TeXworks is a \LaTeX\ editor that is packaged with the newer MiKTeX
distributions, and it can be acquired from \url{http://www.tug.org/texworks/}.

And if you are attached to your \emph{emacs} or \emph{vim} editor, you
can of course edit your \LaTeX\ documents with them.
Emacs at least has syntax coloring and you can compile your document with a key
binding, so this may be a good option if you prefer working with the standard
Linux text editors.

\section{Graphics}

When you use \texttt{pdflatex} to render your thesis, you can include PDF images
directly, as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:indica_model} below.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_indica_model.pdf}
    \caption{The INDICA two-layered value chain model.}
    \label{fig:indica_model}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

You can also include JPEG or PNG files, as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:eeyore}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=9cm]{example_ihaa.jpg}
    \caption{Eeyore, or Ihaa, a very sad donkey.}
    \label{fig:eeyore}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

You can create PDF files out of practically anything.
In Windows, you can download PrimoPDF or CutePDF (or some such) and install a
printing driver so that you can print directly to PDF files from any
application. There are also tools that allow you to upload documents in common
file formats and convert them to the PDF format.
If you have PS or EPS files, you can use the tools \texttt{ps2pdf} or
\texttt{epspdf} to convert your PS and EPS files to PDF\@.

% Comment: If your sentence ends in a capital letter, like here, you should
% write \@ before the period; otherwise LaTeX will assume that this is not
% really an end of the sentence and will not put a large enough space after the
% period. That is, LaTeX assumes that you are (for example), enumerating using
% capital roman numerals, like I. do something, II. do something else. In this
% case, the periods do not end the sentence.

% Similarly, if you do need a normal space after a period (instead of
% the longer sentence separator), use \  (backslash and space) after the
% period. Like so: a.\ first item, b.\ second item.

Furthermore, most newer editor programs allow you to save directly to the PDF
format. For vector editing, you could try Inkscape, which is a new open source
WYSIWYG vector editor that allows you to save directly to PDF\@.
For graphs, either export/print your graphs from OpenOffice Calc/Microsoft
Excel to PDF format, and then add them; or use \texttt{gnuplot}, which can
create PDF files directly (at least the new versions can).
The terminal type is \emph{pdf}, so the first line of your plot file should be
something like \texttt{set term pdf \ldots}.

To get the most professional-looking graphics, you can encode them using the
TikZ package (TikZ is a frontend for the PGF graphics formatting system).
You can create practically any kind of technical images with TikZ, but it has a
rather steep learning curve. Locate the manual (\texttt{pgfmanual.pdf}) from
your \LaTeX\ distribution and check it out. An example of TikZ-generated
graphics is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:page-merge}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \input{example_page-merge.tex}
    \caption{Example of a multiversion database page merge. This figure has
    been taken from the PhD thesis of Haapasalo~\cite{HaapasaloThesis}.}
    \label{fig:page-merge}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Another example of graphics created with TikZ is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tikz-examples}.
These show how graphs can be drawn and labeled.
You can consult the example images and the PGF manual for more examples of what
kinds figures you can draw with TikZ.

% These definitions are only used in the example images; you will not
% need them for your thesis...

\end{figure}



% \input{4methods.tex}

\chapter{Methods}
\label{chapter:methods}

You have now stated your problem, and you are ready to do something
about it!  \emph{How} are you going to do that? What methods do you
use?  You also need to review existing literature to justify your
choices, meaning that why you have chosen the method to be applied in
your work.

% An example of a traditional LaTeX table
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% A note on underfull/overfull table cells and tables:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% In professional typography, the width of the text in a page is always a lot
% less than the width of the page. If you are accustomed to the (too wide) text
% areas used in Microsoft Word's standard documents, the width of the text in
% this thesis layout may suprise you. However, text in a book needs wide
% margins. Narrow text is easier to read and looks nicer. Longer lines are
% hard to read, because the start of the next line is harder to locate when
% moving from line to the next.
% However, tables that are in the middle of the text often would require a wider
% area. By default, LaTeX will complain if you create too wide tables with
% ``overfull'' error messages, and the table will not be positioned properly
% (not centered). If at all possible, try to make the table narrow enough so
% that it fits to the same space as the text (total width = \textwidth).
% If you do need more space, you can either
% 1) ignore the LaTeX warnings
% 2) use the textpos-package to manually position the table (read the package
%    documentation)
% 3) if you have the table as a PDF document (of correct size, A4), you can use
%    the pdfpages package to include the page. This overrides the margin
%    settings for this page and LaTeX will not complain.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Another note:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If your table fits to \textwidth, but the cells are so narrow that the text
% in p{..}-formatted cells does not flow nicely (you get underfull warnings
% because LaTeX tries to justify the text in the cells) you can manually set
% the text to unjustified by using the \raggedright command for each cell
% that you do not want to be justified (see the example below). \raggedleft
% is also possible, of course...
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you need to have linefeeds (\\) inside a cell, you must create a new
% paragraph-formatting environment inside the cell. Most common ones are
% the minipage-environment and the \parbox command (see LaTeX documentation
% for details; or just google for ``LaTeX minipage'' and ``LaTeX parbox'').
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{3.8cm}|p{4.5cm}|p{1.1cm}|}
% Alignment of sells: l=left, c=center, r=right.
% If you want wrapping lines, use p{width} exact cell widths.
% If you want vertical lines between columns, write | above between the letters
% Horizontal lines are generated with the \hline command:
\hline % The line on top of the table
\textbf{Code} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Methods} & \textbf{Area} \\
\hline
% Place a & between the columns
% In the end of the line, use two backslashes \\ to break the line,
% then place a \hline to make a horizontal line below the row
T-110.6130 & Systems Engineering for Data Communications
    Software & \raggedright Computer simulations, mathematical modeling,
  experimental research, data analysis, and network service business

\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|p{6.25cm}|}{Mat-2.3170 Simulation (here is an example of
 multicolumn for tables)}& Details of how to build simulations & T-110 \\
% The multicolumn command takes the following 3 arguments:
% the number of cells to merge, the cell formatting for the new cell, and the
% contents of the cell
\hline
S-38.3184 & Network Traffic Measurements and Analysis
& \raggedright How to measure and analyse network
  traffic & T-110 \\ \hline
\end{tabular} % for really simple tables, you can just use tabular
% You can place the caption either below (like here) or above the table
\caption{Research methodology courses}
% Place the label just after the caption to make the link work
\label{table:courses}
\end{table} % table makes a floating object with a title

If you have not yet done any (real) metholodogical courses (but chosen
introduction courses of different areas that are listed in the
methodological courses list), now is the time to do so or at least
check through material of suitable methodological courses. Good
methodologial courses that consentrates especially to methods are
presented in Table~\ref{table:courses}. Remember to explain the
content of the tables (as with figures). In the table, the last column
gives the research area where the methods are often used. Here we used
table to give an example of tables. Abbreviations and Acronyms is also
a long table. The difference is that longtables can continue to next
page.



% \input{5implementation.tex}

\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:implementation}

You have now explained how you are going to tackle your problem.
Go do that now! Come back when the problem is solved!

Now, how did you solve the problem?
Explain how you implemented your solution, be it a software component, a
custom-made FPGA, a fried jelly bean, or whatever.
Describe the problems you encountered with your implementation work.



% \input{6evaluation.tex}

\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}

You have done your work, but that's\footnote{By the way, do \emph{not} use
shorthands like this in your text! It is not professional! Always write out all
the words: ``that is''.} not enough.

You also need to evaluate how well your implementation works.  The
nature of the evaluation depends on your problem, your method, and
your implementation that are all described in the thesis before this
chapter.  If you have created a program for exact-text matching, then
you measure how long it takes for your implementation to search for
different patterns, and compare it against the implementation that was
used before.  If you have designed a process for managing software
projects, you perhaps interview people working with a waterfall-style
management process, have them adapt your management process, and
interview them again after they have worked with your process for some
time. See what's changed.

The important thing is that you can evaluate your success somehow.
Remember that you do not have to succeed in making something spectacular; a
total implementation failure may still give grounds for a very good master's
thesis---if you can analyze what went wrong and what should have been done.




% \input{7discussion.tex}

\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}

At this point, you will have some insightful thoughts on your implementation
and you may have ideas on what could be done in the future.
This chapter is a good place to discuss your thesis as a whole and to show your
professor that you have really understood some non-trivial aspects of the
methods you used\ldots



% \input{8conclusions.tex}

\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}

Time to wrap it up!
Write down the most important findings from your work.
Like the introduction, this chapter is not very long.
Two to four pages might be a good limit.



% Load the bibliographic references
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can use several .bib files:
% \bibliography{thesis_sources,ietf_sources}
\bibliography{ref}


% Appendices go here
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you do not have appendices, comment out the following lines
\appendix
% \input{appendices.tex}

\chapter{First appendix}
\label{chapter:first-appendix}

This is the first appendix. You could put some test images or verbose data in an
appendix, if there is too much data to fit in the actual text nicely.

For now, the Aalto logo variants are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aaltologo}.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:aaltologo}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


% End of document!
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The LastPage package automatically places a label on the last page.
% That works better than placing a label here manually, because the
% label might not go to the actual last page, if LaTeX needs to place
% floats (that is, figures, tables, and such) to the end of the
% document.
\end{document}
